AS: Ordering of foods / grouping (Banakou…)
I did not check for ordering of each row / entry in the Food names. For the most part, these seemed to follow a consistent approach (alphabetical order, with some exceptions relating to food prep, for example “raw” before “boiled”, etc.). However, I noticed (in passing), at least one place that seemed inconsistent (under Starchy roots, tubers and their products):
- Banakou né barâand kanss saagbo (Burkina Faso)*: Foutou of cassava and unripe plantain 
- Banakou né kou saagbo (Burkina Faso)*: Foutou of yam and cassava
- Banakou né barâand moomd saagbo (Burkina Faso)*: Foutou of cassava and ripe plantain 
RC: Agree. Change order.
VPdQ: We think it can just be done by sorting the items by alphabetical order again, right?
AJV: The short answer is no, sorry! The order of foods in Excel is: 1, By food group; 2, By food name, BUT raw foods come before their cooked counterparts (e.g. Plantain, unripe, pale flesh, raw comes before Plantain, unripe, pale flesh, boiled).",,"2B(19027), 4E(Milk, cow, condensed, sweet / Lait de vache, condensé, sucré), AU14(09A20028), SA1015, UK7(12-520), US28(01095)",1.0,1390.0,329.0,26.9,7.5,8.5,55.6,0.0,1.6,279.0,0.4,28.0,238.0,372.0,325.0,0.95,0.1,92.0,90.0,87.0,30.0,,,0.09,0.38,2.0,0.2,105.0,0.05,11.0,11.0,0.5,4.0,27.0,5.35,2.46,0.22,0.14,0.07,0.0,Milk and its products
